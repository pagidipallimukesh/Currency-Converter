I built a Currency Converter web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to convert money from one country’s currency to another using real-time exchange rates from an API. The interface is simple and user-friendly, where users select currencies and enter an amount to get instant conversion results. Through this project, I improved my skills in JavaScript, API integration, DOM manipulation, and creating responsive web designs.
